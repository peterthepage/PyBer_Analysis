# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to show how, generally, rides differed based on the city type they occurred in.
Using number of fares, number of drivers, and average fares occurring in each city type we are able to differentiate
the city types to show management where investment should occur.

With the information we have from the dataframe created we see that as the city type changes from more dense
to less dense the average far increases. The reason that urban areas are producing the most money is because
of the total number of rides given is much higher than any other area. The number of rides happening in rural 
and suburban areas may also be lower because the urban centers have a lot more drivers as well.

# Summary
Going forward I would recommend 3 plans to increase revenue.
1. Promote getting more suburban drivers signing up. The average fare is significantly higher for these drivers than for those in urban settings. The only reason the urban drivers produce more revenue is because there are nearly 5 times as many drivers.
2. Promote urban driver incentives to drive suburban fairs where possible. Seeing as we seem to have more drivers than rides happening in urban settings there would appear to be an issue with urban driver retention. While more analysis would be needed to ascertain the reason for this; my suspicion is that they do not make enough money per fare. Giving out promotions to have urban drivers leave their usual area but get significantly fares will also help generate more revenue from suburban rides; as well as keep more urban drivers long term.
3.  Introduce surge pricing in urban areas. This will help with urban driver retention, because they will make more per fare. It will also help generate more revenue in the city type where we have the most rides.
